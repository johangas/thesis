README file for using the python TLV scripts
--------------------------------------------------
The following instructions clarify the usage of the python TLV scripts
contained in this folder. The scripts allow the user to test the TLV-based
communication to a Yanzi device (running the Yanzi TLV application stack).

The TLV scripts display valid text-base information if the corresponding
operation (TLV instance) is supported on the Yanzi device, otherwise they
inform the user that the operation is not supported by the loaded firmware.

============================================================================
1. "tlvgettemperature.py": Reading the device temperature

The script returns the device temperature in (C)
Usage:
  ./tlvgettemperature.py [-v] [Device-IPv6-Address] [Instance number]

Option -v introduces verbosity.
The instance number forces the script to look for the temperature instance only on the
specific instance index (not really needed).

2. "tlvgetbutton.py": Reading the status of the user button
Usage:
  ./tlvgetbutton [-v] [Device-IPv6-Address] [Instance number]

Options -v, instance number are as for temperature
The script returns "Button Pressed" or "Button Released", depending on the button status.

3. "tlvgetled.py": Reading the LED status (Orange LED)
Usage:
  ./tlvgetled.py [-v] [Device-IPv6-Address] [Instance number]

The script returns "LED ON", or "LED OFF", depending on the LED status.

4. "tlvsetled.py": Setting the Orange LED (on or off)
Usage:
  "./tlvsetled.py" [-v] [Device-IPv6-Address] [-l] [ON/OFF] [Instance number]

The script confirms the LED setting (ON, or OFF) or indicated invalid argument, otherwise.
If the -l option is not given, or if it is empty, the LED defaults to OFF.
